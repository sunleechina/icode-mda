#summary Automated Shoreline Rate of Change Detection page.

= Introduction =
This page describes current development of the  Automated Shoreline Rate of Change Detection tool for ICODE-MDA, including who is developing the tool, it's status, and technical details with examples.


= Tool Developers =
 * Tsatsu Amable
 * Wahab Sowah
 * Jayson Quashigah


= Current Status of Tool =  
Wahab completed MATLAB script for shoreline detection (algorithm
approved by Cheryl Hapke); Kofi converting MATLAB script to C++
(completion by 16 April, 2012); Kofi finding a way about reading
shapefiles in OSSIM.
(NOTE: Jayson spending several weeks working on shoreline rate of change
using DSAS in ArcGIS (because it is very difficult to read the large
imageries in ArcGIS, keeps crashing. This is one of the flagship
research in the Department).
