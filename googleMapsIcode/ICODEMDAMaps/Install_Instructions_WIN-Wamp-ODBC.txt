Install Instructions for Windows - for PostgreSQL or MySQL database through ODBC connection
(tested on Windows 7, 64-bit)


1) Download Uniform Server (http://www.uniformserver.com/)
  - does not require installation;  this is a portable application
  - extract files and run "Start_as_program.exe"
  - Click on "Start Apache" to start your server

2) Install PostgreSQL driver for ODBC (http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/)
  - this allows a single application to access multiple different databases through Microsoft's ODBC
  - use 32- or 64-bit version, but make sure to update the phpsql_dbinfo.php file accordingly... more information on this below.

3) Copy all files in this directory into a directory in your www directory of the UniSever folder


4) Set up your databases

[PostgreSQL version]
- Open pgAdmin III to create and edit PostgreSQL AIS database/table
  - push some data to your tables

[MySQL version]
- Open phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench and create and edit the AIS database/table
  - push some data to your tables


5) Edit phpsql_dbinfo.php in your www folder
  - update the login information to match that for your database
  - use 'PostgreSQL Unicode', 'PostgreSQL Unicode(x64)' or 'MySQL ODBC 5.2 Unicode Driver' as the odbc_driver
    - bit version you require depends on whether your browser or client is 32- or 64-bits

6) Edit query_current_vessels.php, query_track.php, and query_port.php
  - update the database queries to match your database structure
  - this is the file you would be updating a lot to customize your queries for the map

7) Open a web browser and go to http://localhost to view your map with AIS points
