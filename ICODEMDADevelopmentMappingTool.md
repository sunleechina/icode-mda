# Introduction #

The ICODE-MDA Maps tool allows for developers to display various types of geo-located data on a map.
<p>
The idea is to use this tool to display a large amount of geo-located information and visually represent results from algorithm development.  Usually, Google Earth would be great for this purpose via KML/KMZ files, but when the amount of data becomes too large, this method fails if the developer lacks a very high-end machine with massive amounts of memory.  The ICODE-MDA Maps approach allows the data to be stored and retrieved from a database, which is more robust in storing large amounts of data.<br>
<br>
<h1>Details</h1>

Code is written in HTML, PHP, and JavaScript languages.  The tool should be adaptable to read data from various sources of data stored in a database (i.e. MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and display information about that data, including geolocation of targets and other pertinent information.<br>
